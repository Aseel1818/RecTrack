## Introduction
*****
RecTrack is your new cooking instructor! It is a food recipe application that lets you know how many calories are in a dish,
how long it takes to prepare it, the type of recipe, the ingredients, and how many healthy ingredients are in it. It also includes 
a classification of recipes on the categories page, including the most common ones, such as vegans and meals of the day.
